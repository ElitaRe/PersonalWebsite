	 <h3><i>Me and my family</i></h3>

     <p>
         So I am an 18 years old girl living with her family. I live with my mom, dad and brother who is younger <br>
         than me, so we are a four members family. We live a very happy life and I am grateful for everything I <br>
         have in my life. I am the only girl in the whole family so I am used to everyone's love for me. As I also <br>
         mentioned, I have lived 4 years in Prizren without my family and it was a good experience for me, because <br>
         it was like a preparation to live life without being dependent on my parents.

     <h3><i>My free time</i></h3>

     <p>
         As a student, I am quite busy on weekdays. However, at weekends, I have much free time, so I usually spend <br>
         it on relaxing to prepare for a coming busy week.I like to watch youtube videos and read articles that have to <br>
         do with my career, to improve my self more in that field.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA" target="_blank">(like this one)</a> So I am a person who enjoys the free  <br>
         time more at home with family. But I also have wonderful friends, that is impossible not to spend time with <br>
         them. And of course as most of the people I aslo like to visit different places.

     <h3><i>My hobbies</i></h3>

     <p>
         Hobbies play a very important role in our lives. They occupy our minds when we are free and also make us happy. <br>
         Hobbies are our escape from the real world that makes us forget our worries. Moreover, they make our lives <br>
         interesting and enjoyable. If we look at it, all our hobbies are very useful for us. They teach us a lot of things <br>
         about different stuff. They also help in expanding our knowledge.
