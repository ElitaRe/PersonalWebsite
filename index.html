     <h3><i>My Autobiography</i></h3>

     <p>
         My name is Elita I. Rexha. I was born on 14.01.2002 in Prishtina where I also live. I started<br>
         my education in the elementary school "Hilmi Rakovica" in Prishtina.Then in the 9th grade I got<br>
         transferred to Mehmet Akif College, where I finished high school. During that time I lived in<br>
         Prizren because the school was located  there. I spent very good years of education in that school<br> 
         because the level of learning that they used for me was just perfect.Then high school finished<br>
         and I came back to live in Prishtina with my family.This year I started university at Universum <br>
         College in Computer Science Degree.

     <h3><i>My Experiences</i></h3>

     <p>
         When it comes to job, I have not worked before because I have been going to school and studying all <br>
         the time.But I can mention some experiences I have gone through. Firstly I was part of the children's <br>
         parliament in Kosovo, so it was a "small MP".I got invited in many TV interviews.There was a competition <br>
         "MacPro" organized by Mehmet Akif College where my "RaDrone" project took the Grand Prize and was <br>
         nominated to participate in Genius Olympiad in USA. Recently, me and some of my friends participated as <br>
         a group in the "Nasa Space Apps" competition organized by ICK, where we also won first place with our <br>
         project. It was really a great and hard project at the same time because it took a lot of effort to build <br>
         the robot, put sensors, program ,set Artificial Intelligence... But for me it was a wonderful experience.

     <h3><i>Why a Computer Science Student?!</i></h3>

     <p>
         All students always have in their head the dilemma and the question that they asks theirselves:"What and <br>
         where after high school?"So the preoccupation of what they will decide to study.Each student distinguishes <br>
          a talent in a subject, respectively in a certain field, which they like and attract more. Of course as a <br>
          student I also had these "symptoms".The development of technology recently has been very rapid which has <br>
          aroused my curiosity in this field. In addition to curiosity, I also had a kind of love and desire to enter <br>
          the world of computer science.Therefore, this enthusiasm for computerization and seeing the market demand <br>
          for staff of this profile, I did not find it so difficult to make the selection, for which I think I made <br>
          the right selection.I hope that with my commitment and with the help of the staff of Universum College I <br>
          will not miss the successes and I will be convinced once again that I have made the right choice! <br>
